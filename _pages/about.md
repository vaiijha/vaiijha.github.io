🎓 I'm an Electrical & Electronics engineer from RVCE, Bengaluru. 

🏣 Currently I'm employed at Epsilon with 2 years of experience as Machine Learning (ML) engineer. My work spans building/optimizing data engineering jobs (PySpark, AWS, Azure) to training Deep Learning (DL) models to provide hyper personalised recommendation to consumers.

🔬 My research interests are at the intersection AI and Robotics. I also love to work on AI/Tech for good social projects. I'm currently researching Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and their implementations. 

📩 You can find more about my work at [Projects](https://vaiijha.github.io/projects/ "Projects Page") and [Resume](https://vaiijha.github.io/resume/ "Resume"). Feel free to shoot me a [mail](mailto:vaijha22@gmail.com).
