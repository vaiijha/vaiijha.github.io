##Main Objectives:

1. Study, review & implement ML models for weather forecasting and work on improving its efficiency. The ML models developed as part of this were: VAR, ARIMA & Prophet.
2. To design and implement an efficient and accurate LSTM deep learning model

#Outcomes:

Classical multivariate ML models such as **Prophet and VAR** did better with MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error) values of **12 - 26% (lower the better)**, anything **<10% is considered an highly accurate forcast and <20% is a good forecast**. The deep learning models were prone to overfitting the data with MAPE values of around 40% which would be considererd a reasonable forcecast.

Further access to higher quality data from SolCast made all the models perform much better. We are grateful to them for maintaining such high quality data and making it readily available for research and academic purposes.

This project was carried out as an academic project during my 3rd year under guidance of prof. Sushmita Sarkar at RVCE, Bengaluru.
