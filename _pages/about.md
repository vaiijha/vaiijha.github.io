I am a **Research Associate** at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** in the Computational and Data Science Department, where I contribute to the **DREAM lab**. My current research focuses on building distributed high-performance computing (HPC) applications for **quantum computing and artificial intelligence**.

Previously, I was a **Data Engineer at Epsilon**, where I built and managed end-to-end ML and data ETL pipelines for major brands in the healthcare, auto, and telecom sectors. My work involved handling millions of customer records using technologies like **AWS Glue, PySpark, and Airflow**.

I graduated from R. V. College of Engineering with a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics. My passion lies in applying technology to solve real-world challenges, a drive that led me to design a patented **solar panel cleaning robot** and found **Covid-Seva.org**, a nationwide COVID resource repository that assisted over 50,000 people during the pandemic.

Outside of my professional life, I am an enthusiast of weightlifting, playing the guitar, robotics, and hiking.
