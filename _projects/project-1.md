Results

We designed, fabricated and developed a Solar Panel Cleaning Robot, combining both dry and wet cleaning to **improve cleaning efficiency and reduce operational costs**. Our team achieved a **16.7% lift in efficiency** after dry cleaning and used only **25% of water utilized in wet cleaning as compared to industry practise**.

Design

This robot was also designed to address issues such as human resource unavailiabilty and harm due to harsh temperatures at solar farms. The design of the robot includes automated charging dock from where the robot can be deployed to clean panels at regular intervals.

It has specially designed chassis and wheels which helps to manoeuvre any perturbation between alignments of solar panels, allowing it to comfortably navigating uneven interfaces between panels of 10-20mm. It houses custom designed lightweight brushes for gentle cleaning of the panels, featuring separate dry and wet cleaning brushes.

This is my final year undergrad project (capstone) under the guidance of Prof. Sushmita Sarkar.
